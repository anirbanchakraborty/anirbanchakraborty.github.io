== About me
I am currently a research fellow in the [http://rose.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx {{Rapid-Rich Object Search (ROSE)}}] Lab at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore working on large scale, deployable video surveillance systems. Before joining NTU, I worked as a post-doctoral fellow in the A\*STAR-NUS [http://www.circ.nus.edu.sg {{Clinical Imaging Research Centre}}] at National University of Singapore. I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from [http://www.ucr.edu {{University of California, Riverside}}] under the supervision of [http://www.ee.ucr.edu/~amitrc/ {{Dr. Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury}}] in August, 2014. I obtained my M.S. from the same institute in 2010 and prior to that, my bachelors in Electrical Engineering from [http://www.jaduniv.edu.in {{Jadavpur University}}], India.

== Research interests

I am interested in exploring applications of systems theory, probabilistic graphical models, stochastic processes, geometric tessellation and optimization in a wide range of computer vision and machine learning problems, such as -

- *Video analytics:* Multi-camera surveillance \- person-reidentification, video anomaly detection, activity recognition and forecasting.

- *Biological and medical image analysis:* Bio-image informatics \- registration, cell segmentation, spatio-temporal cell tracking, cell and tissue resolution 3D reconstruction of confocal image stacks.\n
Analysis of clinical MR, CT and $\mu$CT images.
